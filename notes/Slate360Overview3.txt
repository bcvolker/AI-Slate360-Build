Slate360 Website Overview
Generated by Grok on November 15, 2025
This document provides a high-level overview of the Slate360 website, drawing from the project's current structure (public GitHub repo: https://github.com/bcvolker/slate360-rebuild), uploaded files (e.g., feature summaries, code snippets, business plans from "Constructure Website Breakdown.docx" and "Project Overview Slate360.docx"), and chat history. It's designed as a standalone reference for saving as a file (e.g., "Slate360_Overview.md" or .docx). Sections cover how components interconnect, tech stack, homepage links, and business strategy. Athlete360 is noted as experimental (awaiting upload for deep dive—will integrate into Virtual Studio tab for sports applications like motion analysis).
1. How Things Work Together: Core Flows & Interconnectivity
Slate360 is a responsive single-page app (SPA) for built environment professionals (contractors, realtors, drone pilots, universities), blending project management, design, media editing, geospatial planning, virtual visualization, and analytics into a unified dashboard. The site emphasizes 1-3 click workflows, drag-and-drop interfaces, AI toggles (with verification disclaimers), and open exports to avoid lock-in. Data flows seamlessly across tabs via a centralized state (Zustand store), ensuring actions in one tab enrich others without silos.
Key Interconnections & User Journey

Entry Point (Homepage): Teaser tiles showcase features (e.g., Project Hub for management, Design Studio for modeling). CTAs funnel to /subscribe (tiers) or /login (auth). Non-users get public viewers (e.g., shared 360 tours via S3 links—no account needed; optional protected mode for edits).
Authentication & Gating: Supabase auth on /login checks tier (Free: 1GB/5 projects, watermarked; Pro: Unlimited). Dashboard loads conditionally (e.g., freelancers see Project Hub + Content; enterprises get RBAC for team views). Profile selector (e.g., "Construction Pro" vs. "Realtor") customizes defaults (e.g., 360-heavy layout).
Dashboard Hub: Global Toolbar (Save/Undo/Import/Export, AI toggle) consistent across tabs. Centralized dashboardData state syncs everything (e.g., Project Hub location pins → Geospatial missions; Design models → Virtual tours → Analytics reports). Offline: syncQueue queues changes (IndexedDB), auto-flushes on reconnect.
Tab Flows:
Project Hub (Core): Create/track projects (Gantt, budgets, punch lists). Outputs seed tabs (e.g., docs to Analytics templates, locations to Geospatial).
Design Studio (formerly BIM): 2D/3D modeling (IfcOpenShell libs). Flow: Models to 3D Print or Virtual Studio; volumes to Analytics costs.
Content Studio: Edit media (FFmpeg/OpenCV). Flow: Clips to 360 hotspots or Project Hub assets.
360 Tour Builder: Stitch/host tours (Pannellum). Flow: Embed Project Hub pins; share public links.
Geospatial & Robotics: Missions/scans (OpenDroneMap). Flow: Data to Design models or Analytics anomalies.
Virtual Studio (formerly AR/VR): Immersive views (A-Frame). Flow: From Design/Geospatial; Athlete360 experimental sub-module (MediaPipe motion scrubs—applied to sports like swing analysis, not advertised yet).
Analytics & Reports: Pulls from all (Recharts templates). Flow: Auto-queues (e.g., Geospatial scan → risk heatmap); CEO views aggregated metrics.

CEO Tab (Owner-Only): Hidden for you (owner@slate360.ai)—manage users/pricing (Stripe tiers, bulk discounts), upload homepage tiles (S3 drag-drop), promotions (SendGrid). Flow: Monitors tab usage for upsells (e.g., low Analytics? Nudge Pro).
Sharing & Export: Public viewers (S3/CDN links for models/tours—no login; auth for collab). Exports (GLB/PDF/CSV) open-source compatible. Mobile stub: React Native for field uploads (70% reuse).
Data Controls: Tier quotas (Supabase rows: Free pause at 1GB—no overage costs; trial watermarks). AI disclaimers: "Verify results—we disclaim liability."

Overall: Modular (Next.js App Router), scalable (AWS S3/Lambda for processing), user-centric (RBAC for types like freelancers vs. teams; 1-3 clicks via Toolbar).
2. Tech Stack, Dependencies, & Infrastructure
Built for speed/security on a lean stack—AI-assisted (ChatGPT/Copilot for gen, Grok for verify). Focus: Open-source heavy, free tiers first (AWS 5GB storage/1M Lambda requests).
Core Stack

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router for tabs), React 18 (hooks/state), Tailwind CSS (dark theme: #1A1A1A bg, #708090 primary, copper accents; responsive grid/flex).
State/UI: Zustand (dashboardData sync), Framer Motion (Toolbar animations), react-dropzone (uploads), react-tooltip (help icons).
Auth/DB: Supabase (Postgres + Realtime for RBAC/tiers; geospatial PostGIS for maps).
Backend/API: Node/Express stubs (API routes in /app/api for CRUD, e.g., /projects), Stripe (subscriptions), SendGrid (emails).
Media/3D: Three.js/@react-three/fiber (models), Pannellum (360), FFmpeg wasm (video edits), OpenDroneMap (scans).
AI/ML: Hugging Face (YOLOv5 anomalies, Stable Diffusion enhancements—toggle/disclaimer), Gemini (doc review—server-only keys).
Other: Leaflet (maps), jsPDF (reports), IndexedDB (offline via syncQueue).

4. Business Goals & Plan Overview
Slate360 is a SaaS platform targeting $6K/mo revenue to replace your $74K/year job, scaling to $1M ARR Year 1 via network (ASU/construction execs for betas/bulk licenses). Focus: Save users $200-1K/mo by bundling tools (vs. Procore $500+, DroneDeploy $300+). Margins: 85-95% (AWS $0.02/GB, no free overages via quotas).
Goals

Short-Term (Q4 2025): MVP launch (homepage + 4 core tabs), 5-10 beta subs ($2-5K/mo via LinkedIn demos: "Site chaos to VR in 3 clicks"). Test with ASU students/execs (free 3-month trial, convert 50% to $200/mo bundles).
Mid-Term (Q1-Q2 2026): Full tabs + mobile, 40 Pro subs ($6K/mo goal). Spin-offs: 360 Tour Builder for realtors ($75/mo, 10 users = $750/mo).
Long-Term (Year 2+): $50-100K/mo (120 licenses @ $600 bulk), $500K+ Year 2. Exit: Acquire by Autodesk-like (code reuse 70% for niches like Makerspace).

Plan

Monetization: Freemium (1GB free hook), tiers (Starter $49: Core; Pro $149: AI/VR; Enterprise custom: Unlimited + API). Add-ons: Athlete360 $10/mo (experimental sports motion). Bulk: 10 seats $480/mo (20% off). Yearly 10% discount.
Marketing: Zero-budget: LinkedIn videos (tours/models demos), ASU pilots (convert classes to $200 bundles). Virality: Shareable viewers (10% cut on marketplace data sales).
Operations (CEO Tab): User mgmt (ban/tier edits), pricing updates (Stripe previews), homepage uploads (S3 drag-drop), metrics (Chart.js churn/revenue). 90% margins: Quotas pause free processing.
Risks/Mitigation: Churn from AI edges (disclaimers + verify prompts); scale (Vercel/AWS free tiers to 50 users). Profit Projection: Year 1 $380K (50 bulk licenses), Year 5 $2.9M (250 seats + spin-offs).
