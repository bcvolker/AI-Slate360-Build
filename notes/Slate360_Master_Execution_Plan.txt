# Slate360 Execution Plan & To-Do List

## PHASE 0: PRE-FLIGHT (You do this now)
Before asking Copilot to code, gather these keys.
1. [ ] **Domain:** Ensure `slate360.ai` DNS points to Vercel (once deployed).
2. [ ] **Supabase:** Create Project -> Get `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` & `ANON_KEY`.
3. [ ] **Stripe:**
    - Create Subscription Products ($49, $99, $199, $499).
    - Create "Credit Packs" as One-Time Products ($20 for 1k credits).
    - Get `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` & `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
4. [ ] **AWS S3:** Create Bucket -> Get `ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `REGION`, `BUCKET_NAME`.
5. [ ] **Google Maps:**
    - Go to Google Cloud Console.
    - Enable "Maps JavaScript API" and "Maps Static API".
    - Create API Key -> Restrict HTTP Referrer to `*.slate360.ai` (and `localhost:3000` for dev).
    - Get `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`.
6. [ ] **Environment:** Paste all keys into `.env.local`.

## PHASE 1: THE BUILD (Copilot Prompts)
*Use `Master_Architecture_Spec.txt` as the anchor context for every prompt.*

**Step 1: Foundation**
> "Initialize the project structure and package.json based on Section 1 & 2 of `Master_Architecture_Spec.txt`. Run the Supabase migration from `db-schema-spec.txt`. Setup the `useAuthStore` and `useProjectContextStore`."

**Step 2: The Credit System (Financial Protection)**
*Upload `credit-system-spec.txt` (see below).*
> "Implement the Credit System based on `credit-system-spec.txt`. Update the Organization schema to track `credits_balance`. Create the `CreditTopUpModal` component and the backend API route to consume credits."

**Step 3: Dashboard Shell**
> "Build the Dashboard Layout (Sidebar, Header). Integrate the `CreditDisplay` component into the Sidebar so users always see their balance. Wire up `useAuthStore` to protect routes."

**Step 4: Project Hub**
> "Build the Project Hub based on `projecthub3.txt`. Ensure clicking a project sets the Context. Add a 'Storage Used' indicator on the project card derived from file sizes."

**Step 5: Heavy Tabs (The Cost Centers)**
*Upload `Designstudio3.txt`.*
> "Build the Design Studio. IMPORTANT: Before allowing a Model Processing job, check if `org.credits_balance > 100`. If yes, deduct 100 credits via API and start job. If no, show `CreditTopUpModal`."

## PHASE 2: COST & PROFIT ANALYSIS

**Operating Costs (Monthly Base)**
- **Hosting (Vercel Pro):** $20/seat (Start on Hobby for free).
- **Database (Supabase Pro):** $25 (Start on Free).
- **Domain:** ~$2/mo (amortized).
- **Total Fixed Cost:** ~$25 - $50/mo.

**Variable Costs (Passed to User via Credits)**
- **Storage:** You pay AWS $0.023/GB. You charge users ~10 Credits/GB ($0.20 value). **(10x Markup)**
- **AI Processing:** You pay Replicate ~$0.01 per run. You charge 5 Credits ($0.10 value). **(10x Markup)**
- **Maps:** Google Maps gives $200 credit/mo free. High volume is covered by subscription margin.

**Revenue Target: "The Quit Job Number"**
- **Goal:** $11,000/mo profit.
- **Strategy:** 22 Users @ $499/mo = $10,978.
- **Safety:** If a user consumes $100 of AWS data, they will have burned through their base credits and paid you extra via Top-Ups. You are protected.

## PHASE 3: DATA CONTROLS STRATEGY (Transparency)

1.  **The "Cost Estimator" UI:**
    - Before any heavy action (3D convert, Video Render), show a modal:
    - *"This job requires 50 Credits. You have 4,200 remaining."*
    - Buttons: [Cancel] [Confirm & Deduct].

2.  **The "Storage Thermometer":**
    - In "My Account", show a bar graph: "45GB / 50GB Included".
    - At 100%, uploads pause unless they buy "Storage Expansion" (Credit drain).

3.  **The "Whale" Circuit Breaker:**
    - Set AWS Budgets (in AWS Console) to alert you if total bill > $50.
    - Set Supabase Spend Cap to prevent runaway DB costs.
