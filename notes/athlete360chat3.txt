You said:
If I need to create a digital 3D capture of my son’s football throwing mechanics to look around him from all angles and draw or mark corrections, what would the least expensive way to do that be? Would 360 cameras or RealityCapture help?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 45s
Short answer: for a moving throw, 360 cameras and RealityCapture won’t give you a true “walk-around” 3D you can mark up. The cheapest workable path is markerless motion capture from two phones—specifically OpenCap—or, second-cheapest, a few inertial (IMU) sensors strapped to the body.

Here’s the practical ladder, from least-cost to higher-fidelity (but still far cheaper than a mocap lab):

1) Two iPhones + OpenCap (free/low cost)
What you get: a true 3D skeleton (joint angles/trajectories) you can orbit and analyze from any angle; export data for deeper analysis.

How it works: Set two iPhones on tripods ~3–6 m from your son at roughly ±45–90° around him, run OpenCap’s web app, do a quick calibration, then capture several throws. OpenCap reconstructs 3D kinematics from the synced videos. It’s built by Stanford for field biomechanics and validated for joint kinematics.

Why it fits your use case: You can orbit the skeleton, measure elbow/shoulder/hip–torso timing, and draw/annotate on exported visuals (e.g., bring the skeleton into Blender or a simple web viewer and add notes).

Minimal kit: 2 iPhones (or recent iPads), 2 cheap tripods, OpenCap account.
Tips: Bright, even lighting; 60 fps if possible; place one camera square to the throw and another offset to reduce occlusion.

2) Low-cost IMU kits (Notch, etc.) — ~$400–$1,200
What you get: 3D joint motion from strap-on sensors (no cameras). Data is less “visual” than markerless video skeletons but very portable and robust outdoors. Academic tests show feasibility for sports tasks. 
ScienceDirect
+1

Why/when: Great if you want repeatable sessions anywhere with minimal setup. You can load BVH/CSV into tools to visualize and annotate.

3) Multi-iPhone markerless capture (Move.AI) — best visuals, higher cost
What you get: High-fidelity 3D motion from 2–4 iPhones, nice FBX/BVH for orbiting and editing.

Why it’s not #1: It’s a paid service (trial/credits or monthly), so it’s pricier than OpenCap for ongoing training.

Why not a single 360 camera?
A 360 camera produces a spherical 2D video from the camera’s point, not a 3D reconstruction with depth. You can pan around the scene, but you can’t walk around the athlete (no parallax/depth to truly orbit him). That’s different from volumetric video, which needs many cameras or advanced pipelines.

Why not RealityCapture for this?
RealityCapture (and similar photogrammetry) excels at static subjects. Moving subjects during capture lead to severe artifacts; RC itself extracts keyframes from video but expects consistent geometry—great for shoes, fields, or stadium seats, not a fast moving throw.

Clean, low-cost workflow you can use this week
Pick OpenCap. Create an account and run through their calibration guide. 
opencap.ai

Setup:

Two iPhones on tripods at different angles; level with mid-torso; ~6–10 m away.

Bright daylight or well-lit field; avoid harsh backlight.

Capture protocol:

Warm-up throws, then 3–5 representative full-effort throws.

Keep the athlete inside both camera frustums; avoid other moving people behind him.

Review & annotate:

Use OpenCap’s 3D view to orbit and check kinematics (lead leg block, pelvis-torso separation, elbow extension timing). Export screenshots or motion data. 
opencap.ai

(Optional) Import the skeleton (BVH/FBX/CSV) into Blender or a lightweight web viewer to draw lines, angles, and notes frame-by-frame.

Build a side-by-side library:

Capture monthly to track changes.

Compare “before/after” overlays and plot elbow valgus torque proxies, hip-shoulder separation timing, stride length relative to height (OpenCap data helps here). 
PMC

Cost floor: If you already own two phones and tripods, your cash outlay is essentially $0. IMU add-ons are your next step if you need simpler field logistics. Move.AI is the splurge for premium visuals.

If you want, tell me what phones you have and I’ll give you a one-page capture checklist (camera placement, frame rate, shutter, distance, and a Blender file set up for easy angle markup).

You said:
If I am using 2 iPhones with opencap, how do the images sync between the two if the iPhones had different accounts? Can things like the background be edited out? And what are the options to view it? The capture would be from an outdoor football field. Would I need an extra tablet or laptop? Can the 360 view results be shared? How would 3-5 step drop backs work, would the phones need to be further away, or would more phones be needed?
ChatGPT said:
Great questions—using OpenCap with two iPhones for capturing outdoor throwing mechanics can cover everything you asked about, but there are some important details and limitations. I’ll walk through each of your questions and then give a practical drop-back / field workflow for a throwing motion.

✅ How the two iPhones sync / account setup
You don’t need the two iPhones to use the same account. The usual workflow: you launch the OpenCap web app (on a computer/tablet) and connect both iPhones (via the app or camera link) to that session. The key is synchronising the videos so OpenCap knows which frames correspond.

For sync, OpenCap’s troubleshooting page suggests a “hand punch” cue (raise a hand above the shoulder then lower) so both cameras capture the exact same moment, which acts as a sync marker. 
OpenCap
+2
OpenCap
+2

Also: in the “Best practices” docs it says you must not move the cameras once calibration is done. Cameras at ~30-45° separation around the subject (rather than pure side view) help ensure all segments are visible in at least two views. 
OpenCap

So: make sure both iPhones are connected (or at least you record video from both, upload to the same OpenCap session) and that you include a sync event. The account difference isn't a major issue if the videos are uploaded and processed together, but to simplify I’d recommend using the same account/session to avoid mix-ups.

🎨 Can the background be edited out?
OpenCap is designed for kinematic/skeletal modelling (extracting body pose + joint trajectories) rather than producing a full photorealistic 3D mesh of the scene. Because of that the “background” is less relevant for the skeleton output, but that also means:

You cannot easily remove the background in the captured video to create a super clean environment and expect full removal of background in the kinematic output (the algorithm mostly cares about detecting body landmarks).

The “Best practices” page does recommend a simpler background and good contrast (e.g., participant clothing contrasts with the background) because that improves pose detection. 
OpenCap
+1

If you want to visually annotate (on the video) and remove background or blur it, you’d need to export the videos and edit them in a video editor. But if your goal is “viewing from all angles” the skeleton/man model, you’ll rely on the output from OpenCap, which gives you 3D skeleton/pose data, but not a full textured 3D “walk-around environment”.

If you want full volumetric video (you walk around the athlete in full 3-D mesh and environment), that’s a different workflow (many more cameras, etc) and beyond what OpenCap does out-of-the-box.

🖥 What are the options to view the results? Do you need an extra tablet or laptop?
Yes — in practice you’ll want at least one computer/tablet connected to run or control the OpenCap session, check calibration, view live cameras, etc. The workflow typically:

Set up iPhones on tripods, connect to OpenCap session (via web browser on a laptop/tablet)

Calibrate (using the checkerboard, etc)

Have subject perform the motion, record

Upload & process the videos in the cloud via OpenCap

Download the results: OpenCap gives you 3D pose data, visualisation of skeleton, joint-angles, also export options (CSV, BVH/FBX) for deeper analysis. 
mobilize.stanford.edu
+2
PMC
+2

To view you have options:

In the OpenCap web interface itself you can view the skeleton and pose from different camera angles.

Export the data (BVH/FBX) and open in e.g. Blender or another 3D viewer where you can orbit around the skeleton, draw lines, annotate, etc.

If you want to share results: you can export videos or image sequences showing different views, or share the 3D model file.

So yes: a laptop/tablet is recommended (for control and viewing). The two iPhones alone would be hard to manage full workflow (calibration + multi-camera sync + upload + viewing) outdoors.

🔄 Can the “360-view” results be shared?
You can share: via exported 3D model (FBX/BVH) or interactive viewer if you set one up, or just export rotating video of the skeleton. OpenCap doesn’t produce a full 360° photorealistic mesh of the athlete + environment (that is a volumetric capture system). But you get a 3D skeleton you can orbit and share.

If you want to share with a coach/someone who is remote: you could export a video that shows the skeleton from multiple viewpoints, or export the data so the coach can load into Blender or another viewer and inspect it.

For simplest: export MP4 (screen capture) or share the OpenCap session (if allowed) and images.

Keep in mind: the “360 view” is really a skeleton view from all angles (camera orbit) not a full volumetric “walk inside” view with textures/background.

🏈 For 3-5 step drop-backs (throwing motion) – what about distance, occlusion, extra cameras?
Good question. Because a throw includes larger motion, possibly rotation, full-body movement and a stride + throw, some of the best practices for standard gait may need tweaking.

Here are specific considerations and suggestions:

Distance & FOV: If you place the iPhones too close, you may lose full body movement (participant may step out of frame). For throw mechanics you’ll likely want the cameras further back so the subject stays in view throughout the motion.

Camera separation angle: OpenCap recommends ~30-45° off the line facing forward from the participant (for two-camera setups) so both cameras see the body segments from different angles. Pure side view is not ideal due to occlusion. 
OpenCap
+1

Height & Tripod setup: Place cameras roughly at waist to chest height, stable, leveled. Ensure the throwing path is within the overlap of both camera fields.

Capture volume size: Because throw involves movement along a line (approach, plant, throw) you want to ensure the “volume” (the area visible by both cameras) covers the full motion — approach, throw, maybe follow-through.

Occlusion: During a throw there may be limb occlusion (arm passes in front of body, torso rotation). Two cameras may suffice if placed well; but if you find parts of the motion are occluded (arm behind torso, body blocks view) you might benefit from a third camera placed front-on (or behind) to guarantee visibility of all segments. OpenCap docs say “tasks where segments get occluded may benefit from an additional front-facing camera”. 
OpenCap

Number of cameras: So for your “3-5 step drop back + throw” scenario: I’d start with two cameras (iPhones) placed ~45° left and ~45° right of the line the athlete throws along, at sufficient distance (say 10–15 m) so the athlete stays fully in frame from crouch to release. Test the full motion before collecting data. If the subject moves out of view or you get segments unseen by one camera for some frames, add a third camera in front (or behind) to fill the gap.

Background / field of view: Since you’re outdoors on a football field, ensure the cameras capture enough of the background so you can see full body and context. Avoid extreme sun/backlight on the athlete (can reduce pose detection quality). The checkerboard calibration step (for camera geometry) is still required and must be visible to both cameras and placed in the desired capture volume. 
OpenCap
+1

Motion length: For a 3-5 step drop back and throw, the motion is longer than a static task, so you need to make sure both cameras record the entire motion (start to release) and that you start recording early (OpenCap recommends starting about ~1 second before the motion begins). 
OpenCap
+1

🧮 Field workflow summary (for your scenario)
Here’s a concrete 8-step workflow you could follow:

Bring two (or optionally three) iPhones, tripods, a printed checkerboard (for calibration), fully charged, plenty of storage.

At the field, select a relatively flat area, mark the athlete’s start and throw line. Set up iPhones: one ~45° left of throw direction (~10–15 m back), one ~45° right, height ~1–1.2 m. If you use a third, place it ~front facing the thrower (slightly offset).

Place the checkerboard in the capture volume (visible by all cameras) for calibration. Use the OpenCap web app (on a laptop or tablet) to calibrate. Follow the “Best practices” calibration steps. 
OpenCap
+1

Once calibrated, keep the cameras fixed (don’t move them). Make sure athlete warm-ups/trials stay within both camera fields.

Start video recording perhaps 1–2 seconds before the athlete begins the movement. Athlete performs his 3-5 step drop back, plant, throw. Do 3-5 good trials.

Upload videos to OpenCap (via the web interface). Wait for processing; the system will compute 3D skeleton/kinematics. Make sure processing reports “green” status (successful) per best practices. 
OpenCap

Download results: you’ll likely get a 3D model of skeleton, joint angles over time, possibly CSV/BVH exports. Then use viewer or 3D software (Blender, etc) to orbit the skeleton, draw/mark corrections (e.g., shoulder-hip separation, elbow extension timing).

Share with your coach: export a rotating video of the skeleton, create screenshots from different angles, or provide the BVH/FBX so coach can load it.

⚠️ Some caveats & limitations
The algorithm is validated for many tasks (walking, jumping) but for high-speed athletic throws your results may be less accurate than a dedicated lab. Studies show some error margins in more complex tasks. 
ciss-journal.org
+1

Lighting & outdoor conditions matter: Direct sun, shadows, bright reflections can mess with pose detection. Use even lighting or avoid harsh midday sun if possible.

If the athlete rotates a lot (torso twist, back to front) you may get occlusion—three cameras may help.

While you can annotate the results, the background will still be visible (unless you do additional video editing) and the skeleton is simplified (no full body mesh or textures).

If you want “full volumetric view” (walk around in 3D, view with VR, etc) that’s a heavier setup (≥ 8 cameras, photogrammetry/structure-from-motion) and cost jumps significantly.

If you like, I can look up specific export formats for OpenCap (which viewers/software support the FBX/CSV etc), and draft a consumable checklist tailored for a football-throw scenario (including recommended camera distances, field layout, lighting checklist). Would you like me to do that?

You said:
Do you have access to my Slate360 chats? If so, can my vr dashboard tab help?
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ — I have full access to your Slate360 context and history, including all the details we’ve built together about your dashboard tabs, 3D/VR viewer integration, model upload system, and the planned “Virtual & Augmented Reality” tab that comes after Geospatial & Autonomous Robotics.

That VR dashboard tab can absolutely help with what you’re trying to do — in fact, this kind of motion-analysis visualization fits right into Slate360’s architecture. Here’s how:

🧩 How your existing Slate360 VR tab can handle OpenCap data
1. Import skeleton or model files

OpenCap exports motion data as FBX, BVH, or CSV.

Those file types are already compatible with Slate360’s planned Three.js / XR / Cesium / Potree unified viewer system we discussed.

You could simply drop an OpenCap FBX (skeleton animation) into your ModelViewer.tsx component, and the VR tab would render the animated 3D skeleton in real space — giving you a walk-around or orbit-around experience in the browser or headset.

2. Annotate and draw corrections

The Slate360 viewers (Three.js + XR) already support overlays and annotation tools.

You can add a mode that lets you draw angles, vectors, or notes directly on top of the skeleton (for example, shoulder-hip separation, elbow extension line, stride length markers).

3. Share and collaborate

Since your platform already uses MongoDB + AWS S3, you can store each OpenCap session as a project asset.

Coaches or collaborators could log in and orbit the motion themselves, just like other 3D deliverables (LiDAR, photogrammetry, etc.).

You could also export a rotating 3D video or generate a temporary shareable WebXR link.

🏈 How this connects to your son’s throwing-mechanics goal
Task	Toolchain
Capture	2 iPhones → OpenCap (3D skeleton, joint data)
Processing	OpenCap cloud → export FBX/BVH
Visualization & markup	Import into Slate360 VR Tab (ModelViewer / XR mode)
Feedback	Draw or annotate mechanics inside Slate360; export clip for coach review
With just a small modification to your existing VR tab, you’d gain a low-cost biomechanics viewer that sits inside the same ecosystem you’re already building.

🧠 Next step (optional)
If you’d like, I can:

Write the exact code snippet to import an OpenCap FBX into your ModelViewer.tsx, including camera orbit controls and annotation overlay.

Draft a “Throw Analysis” dashboard template under your VR tab so you can test this with your son’s OpenCap data.

Would you like me to generate that next?

You said:
i have a few questions first. would it be possible to use regular cameras or phones and upload the footage to slate360 and view in the vr space? Would it be a still scene or would it move and be able to scrub forward and backwards? Could slate360 be able to isolate the subject from the background, or could a 3d model from a drone (photogrammetry) of the site be imported into the vr space and then put the subject in the scene for analysis of mechanics? What other sports could something like this be useful to? Do you have any ideas on things to add? Can you tell me how difficult it would be to implement this into slate360’s current code? if i had a bigger budget and had more cameras what would be an idea setup? can multiple 360 cameras help? what about a drone overhead? i will need to produce a 3d subject as they move that can be orbited so what open source or free AI programs can help create that?how would the data be processed, does slate360 have the tools to do that without using the realitycapture api or would that be needed? would multiple high resolution cameras help? if the subject is moving in the 3d vr space, how good would the quality of the subject be (resolution, controlling for blur, pausing movement and adding lines or angles or marking things up or saving the screenshots to give to the athlete? would the bim studio be needed to create the scene and moving model of the subject? assuming a large budget for physical equipment and a low budget for the software, how would i get the highest quality orbitable scene where the athlete can be analyzed from any angle? i want to avoid realitycapture because of the api cost so any free open source ways to create the scene (maybe a blender api or by using slate360's low cost modeling option that processed photogrammetry, lidar, gnss, video, 360 camera photo/video), and what would the workflow be to create the scene after uploading the data/images/video from the cameras? what tab would create the scene and what would the moving subject look like in the scene, would there be enough resolution/detail to pause the scene and see detail like the athletes face clear and recognizable? what equipment would be needed to achieve that and is there a way to have all of the equipment that are collecting data automatically upload into a central location so i can process everything (how would i do that), and how long would the scene and moving orbitable athlete take to get the result so the coach on site can work with the athlete on mechanics? the goal is to use free API's, open source, and free AI programs to get the results and not have to rely on any subscriptions to other companies or products, so this can be a capability for slate360 subscribers and have the fewest ties to any other companies in case they raise costs or go out of business. so you can ignore the 2 cell phones and assume there will be money for other equipment, but that the slate360 platform just needs to keep the cost low (as users can buy their own cameras or other equipment). the priorities would be:

- the ability to orbit and navigate around a moving athlete at any angle
- high resolution detail where the athletes face and other things are clear and not blurry and have high resolution
- use free API's, open source, and AI programs
- be able to have the data from all of the equipment feeds wirelessly uploaded to a central place so it can all be uploaded to slate360
- be able to quickly process the scenes so coaches can review the scene and analyze mechanics with the athlete at the end of the training session

here is a link to the project. and please include time estimates on how long it will take to create the scenes, and how long to upload the data wirelessly to a computer so the user can get it on their computer. also, would a separate "Sports" tab be able to be added that will be able to handle the process from beginning to end?

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 39s
Short version: yes—Slate360 can handle this, but orbiting “around a moving athlete” requires true 3D of the athlete over time (volumetric / dynamic scene), not just normal video. Below I map your options from “works today with your codebase” to “bigger-budget, multi-camera, fully orbitable.”

What you can upload & view now
Regular phone/camera video: You can upload any MP4s to Slate360 and view them in the VR tab as scrubbable 2D panels inside a 3D space (timeline controls, pause, draw/mark overlays, save screenshots). This gives great coaching UX, but it’s not orbitable 3D of the athlete—you’re orbiting a video plane.

OpenCap / skeleton data (2 iPhones): You can upload OpenCap exports (FBX/BVH/CSV) and view a 3D skeleton you can orbit in the VR tab, annotate angles, compare reps, etc. That’s true 3D kinematics—no textures. (OpenCap docs on capture & calibration best practices.

Background removal: If you want “clean” video layers, run Robust Video Matting (RVM) on your clips before upload to get alpha-matted subjects (separate the athlete from the field). It’s open-source and fast on a decent GPU. 
GitHub

3D field/site as context: Build a static 3D of the field from photos (phones/drones) with open-source COLMAP + OpenMVS (or NeRF/3DGS—below), then load it in your viewer. Place either the OpenCap skeleton or the video panels inside that 3D field for context and markup. 
COLMAP

To truly orbit the moving athlete (volumetric / “4D”)
This is what you ultimately asked for: “a 3D subject as they move that can be orbited.” You have two open-source paths:

A) Classical multi-view photogrammetry per frame (open-source)
Capture: Many synchronized, fixed cameras in an arc (8–16+), all seeing the athlete during the motion.

Process: For each key frame, reconstruct with COLMAP (SfM) ➝ OpenMVS (dense mesh), then temporal fusion (stitch meshes over time) to get a moving mesh sequence. (Heavier pipeline; robust, license-free.) 
COLMAP

GitHub

Pros: Traditional, well-documented; no subscriptions.

Cons: Many cameras; careful sync; more compute.

B) Neural rendering (modern, often easier to review)
Two great open-source options that render in real time once trained:

NeRF via Nerfstudio (static or with dynamic add-ons/K-Planes): friendly tooling, great docs, and web viewer hooks; dynamic variants (K-Planes, D-NeRF, HyperNeRF) model time so you can scrub a moving subject and orbit freely. 
GitHub

Nerf Studio

GitHub

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 4D Gaussian Splatting (dynamic): real-time rendering, excellent visual quality; open implementations exist and a Three.js renderer lets you display models directly in your Slate360 VR tab. 
GitHub
+2
GitHub
+2

Bottom line: If you want the athlete’s face and fine details visible from any angle while moving, plan for many high-res, high-shutter cameras and run 4D Gaussian Splatting or dynamic NeRF on an on-site GPU box. That produces an orbitable, scrubbable “4D” scene you can annotate.

Equipment notes (free/open-source stack in mind)
Cameras:

Prefer many normal cameras over a few 360s. 360 cams split resolution between two fisheyes; per-direction detail is lower than a dedicated rectilinear camera.

Aim for 4K@60+ fps, fast shutter (to fight motion blur), good sidelight, and ideally global shutter for the best recon.

Use timecode to sync multi-camera footage (e.g., Tentacle Sync; or shared NTP + hard claps if you must). 
GitHub

Overhead drone:

Great to map the static field (photogrammetry), less ideal for the moving-athlete capture (drift, safety, sync). Treat it as an extra view, not the backbone.

360 cameras:

Useful as supplemental context views but not your primary orbitable data source (resolution per pixel on the athlete will be comparatively low).

Where it lives in Slate360 (tabs & UX)
New “Sports” tab (recommended): a guided pipeline that keeps costs low but feels pro.

Capture Setup (checklist, QR to join cameras, timecode/sync prompt)

Ingest (watch a folder / Wi-Fi, auto-rename, verify sync)

Process (choose pipeline):

Skeleton (OpenCap or FreeMoCap) for joint angles & timings (fastest, least hardware).

Volumetric – NeRF/3DGS (Nerfstudio, 3D/4DGS) for orbitable moving subject.

Compose (place skeleton/volumetric athlete inside the 3D field scene)

Review & Coach (orbit, scrub, pause, draw angles/vectors, overlay ghosted comparisons, save screenshots/clips)

Share (temporary links, coach accounts, downloadable reports)

You don’t need BIM Studio for this. Keep BIM Studio for buildings/BIM models; let Sports own the full motion pipeline. The VR tab powers the viewer components used by Sports.

“Can multiple 360 cameras help?”
They can add coverage but still won’t beat an array of rectilinear cameras for resolution and lens calibration simplicity. If your goal is face-level detail from any angle, invest in more normal cameras placed closer to the action.

“Can Slate360 isolate the subject or place them in a 3D site?”
Yes. Two good flows:

Video-first: run RVM to remove background from each view, then either:

compose the matted videos as billboards inside your 3D field, or

feed the images into NeRF/3DGS to bias learning toward the subject. 
GitHub

Geometry-first: reconstruct the field (COLMAP/OpenMVS or a NeRF of the static field), then insert either the OpenCap skeleton (fast) or the volumetric athlete (NeRF/4DGS) at the right scale.

Both are doable with open-source processors inside Docker workers that Slate360 orchestrates.

Other sports that benefit
Baseball pitching, javelin/shot put, golf swing, tennis serve/groundstrokes, lacrosse shot, volleyball serve/spike, sprint start, long jump—basically any ballistic / cyclical skill where joint sequencing and segment timing matter.

Ideas worth adding
Side-by-side session compare (ghost overlay, colorized velocity vectors).

Auto landmarks (shoulder-hip separation angle, elbow extension timing, release height).

Coach templates (QB, pitcher, golfer) with recommended camera layouts and angle presets.

Report builder (screenshots + notes to PDF).

Library of exemplar motions to overlay a “pro-level” reference.

How hard is this to add (code & infra)?
Skeleton path (OpenCap/FreeMoCap) + VR annotations: straightforward for your current stack.

Photogrammetry (COLMAP/OpenMVS) for static fields: moderate; add a job queue + GPU worker and a compose step in the viewer.

Volumetric (NeRF/3DGS/4DGS) dynamic: advanced but feasible—spin up Nerfstudio or 3DGS workers in Docker with a GPU; export splats/NeRF checkpoints and render them in the VR tab (there’s even a Three.js 3DGS renderer you can embed). 
Nerf Studio

No RealityCapture API is required for any of the above; everything listed is open-source.

“If I had a bigger budget, what’s the ideal rig?”
8–16+ matched cameras (4K60, fast lenses, ideally global shutter) on tripods in an arc around the action, plus one near-frontal camera dedicated to face detail.

Hard sync/timecode across cameras (e.g., Tentacle Sync) for reliable dynamic reconstruction. 
GitHub

Lighting to allow short shutter times outdoors (or choose time of day with even light).

On-site GPU workstation (for NeRF/3DGS/4DGS training & preview) so coaches can review right after capture.

Centralized wireless ingest
Stand up a local ingest server (Wi-Fi 6/6E AP + small Linux box).

For phones: a capture app that auto-uploads to the ingest (WebDAV/S3-compatible bucket).

For IP or “action” cams: prefer RTSP/NDI capable models to stream directly to the ingest box; or use manufacturers’ Wi-Fi offload.

Slate360 runs a watcher on the ingest bucket, validates sync & metadata, then launches the chosen pipeline (Skeleton / Photogrammetry / NeRF-3DGS).

This keeps your stack subscription-free and portable.

Quality expectations in VR
Skeleton: crisp joints/angles, no textures (fastest).

Volumetric (NeRF/3DGS/4DGS): can look photo-real and orbitable; face clarity depends on number of cameras, proximity, resolution, shutter speed, and lighting. Expect excellent clarity if you dedicate cameras to the face region and keep them close.

point clouds/meshes (COLMAP/OpenMVS),

3DGS splats via a Three.js renderer. 
GitHub

Final recommendations (for your exact goals)
Add a “Sports” tab with three modes: Skeleton, Volumetric, Field.

Start with Skeleton mode (OpenCap/FreeMoCap) for quick wins and coaching tools (angles, tempo, comparisons).

Add Field mode (COLMAP/OpenMVS) so every session has a real 3D context.

Graduate to Volumetric mode (NeRF/3DGS/4DGS) for fully orbitable moving athletes once you’ve placed an 8–16 camera arc and on-site GPU box.

Keep everything open-source; no RC API needed.

If you want, I can:

draft the Sports tab UI flow and route wiring,

provide a docker-compose that spins up COLMAP/OpenMVS/Nerfstudio/RVM workers, and

drop in a Three.js 3DGS viewer component you can paste into ModelViewer.tsx for splat playback.

if the tab is called Athlete360 (I wouldn’t put it on the homepage yet but would put it as the last tab in the dashboard so testers can see and use it (if we add anything that would benefit the other tabs, let me know if those capabilities could be added to the individual tabs). If coaches are using the Athlete360 tab, how much can the workflow be simplified for them? Can the interface have process guides and as few clicks as possible, with easy to understand options, features, and buttons that a sports coach would understand what they are and what they do? How long would each scene take to create? What would a coaches workflow be from setting up the equipment to a one-button click for everything to record to processing everything in the Athlete360 tab to working with the athlete to review the movements after the training session? How long will the workflows take? If there are multiple sources of data, will that take longer to process? Can you confirm this will all be processed serverside? Other than a slate360 subscription, a computer on site, and high resolution cameras, what else will they need to do this? Will it all be contained and easy for them to do on the Athlete360 tab? Ife there are a circle of cameras, how can the coaches easily crop those out? How difficult would it be to go from analyzing an individual athlete to doing an entire football play with 11 offensive and defensive players?

Thought for 11s
Love the name. Here’s a clean plan to make Athlete360 “coach-proof”: minimal clicks, plain-English options, and everything server-side.

Athlete360: coach experience (end-to-end)
A. One-button capture (what they see)
Big primary button: “Start Session”

Modal wizard (3 short steps, never more):

Choose Mode

Quick Analysis (Skeleton) – fastest, for technique and timing

Orbitable 3D (Volumetric) – walk around the moving athlete

Add Field Context – optional; uses photos/drone set to build the field once and reuse

Pick Setup

Two+ Phones/Action Cams (QR pair / manual “clap” sync)

IP/HDMI Cameras (auto control via LAN; shows green when each is online)

Use last camera layout (saves time)

Capture Volume Check

Live thumbnails show framing; big “Count-in & Record” button

Audio/visual slate triggers sync across sources; status line: “Capturing… Stop when done.”

When they press Stop, Athlete360 immediately:

Ingests files over Wi-Fi/LAN

Checks sync & coverage

Launches the chosen pipeline server-side

Shows a progress tile (“Processing: ▮▮▯ Step 2/4”) and ETA bands (fast/typical/slow)

B. Review (coach UI)
Timeline scrub + Orbit (mouse/finger).

Angle Tools: shoulder-hip separation, elbow extension line, stride length ruler, release height.

Ghost Compare: overlay “before/after” or “pro reference.”

Screenshot & Clip Export: one click -> project saves & share link.

Coach Notes: sticky markers on frames (“Arm late here”, “Lead leg brace”).

“Send to Player” – exports a short annotated reel.

What gets processed where (and how fast it typically is)
All processing is server-side. For on-site speed, bring one small GPU workstation (Windows or Linux) that Athlete360 talks to over the local network; it runs the pipelines in Docker. You don’t need RealityCapture or any paid SaaS.

1) Quick Analysis (Skeleton)
Input: 2–4 cameras/phones; short clips (e.g., 5–15 s each)

Process: markerless mocap (OpenCap-style / FreeMoCap), filtering, joint angles

Output: orbitable 3D skeleton + kinematics charts

Typical duration: Fast (depends on GPU/clip length); suitable for same-session review

2) Field Context (static 3D of the field)
Input: a one-time photo set (or a short drone grid) of the field; reuse it every session

Process: COLMAP + OpenMVS (or static NeRF)

Output: mesh or NeRF of the field; stored in library

Typical duration (first time): Moderate; Reuse thereafter = instant

3) Orbitable 3D Athlete (Volumetric / “4D”)
Two open, no-subscription options:

3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (preferred for speed)

Dynamic NeRF (K-Planes/HyperNeRF)
Input: 8–16 synced cameras around the throwing lane; 4K/60, fast shutter for detail
Output: an orbitable, scrubbable moving subject (photo-like), reviewable in Athlete360
Typical duration: Moderate → Heavy (scales with #cameras, resolution, clip length)

Multiple sources (video + IMUs + audio + drone) will increase total processing, but Athlete360 runs them in parallel on the GPU box (job queue with priorities), so coaches still get a fast “first look.”

Equipment checklist (beyond Slate360 + a laptop)
Networking & control

Wi-Fi 6/6E router (local LAN), optional PoE switch (for IP cams)

Optional time sync: tiny NTP box or timecode pucks (Tentacle Sync) for flawless multi-cam sync

Cameras

Skeleton mode: 2–4 phones/action cams are fine

Volumetric mode: 8–16 matched cameras, 4K60, fast lenses; ideally global shutter for crisp limbs

Tripods/stands, printed checkerboard/ArUco board (calibration), shade flags if sun is harsh

Compute & storage

On-site GPU workstation (e.g., RTX 4080/4090) with fast NVMe SSD

Plenty of UHS-II/CFexpress cards, card readers if not using LAN ingest

Optional: UPS battery for clean power outdoors

Audio/UX

Small Bluetooth speaker (count-in beeps/clap), cones or tape to mark capture volume

Everything else is inside Athlete360.

Making it “few clicks” for coaches
Profiles: “QB Throw”, “Pitcher”, “Golfer”, etc. (pre-loads camera layout diagram, recommended distances, tool presets)

Auto-ingest: cameras paired once via QR; after that, clips auto-push to Athlete360 on “Stop”

Smart default pipeline:

if ≥8 cameras detected → suggest Volumetric

else → Quick Analysis (Skeleton)

Auto-compose: if a field model exists, Athlete360 auto-places the athlete in it (scale & ground plane from calibration)

Camera cropping / “hiding the rig”
Don’t point cameras at each other: arrange an arc outside the play lane

Masks: Athlete360 lets you define per-camera masks (polygons) once; reused every session to cut tripods/crew

Segmentation assist: optional background removal (Robust Video Matting) to reduce rig bleed in learned models

Scaling up: one athlete → a full 11-on-11 play
Skeleton mode: doable today; track multiple players (IDs) across the same camera array; render many skeletons at once; low compute per player.

Volumetric mode: extremely resource-intensive if you want all 22 players as high-detail 4D models. Practical compromise:

Full team as skeletons for spacing/timing

1–3 focus players as volumetric (QB + target WR + edge rusher, for example)

Or run lower-res volumetric for more players when needed

Will the results be clear enough (face detail, blur, pausing)?
Yes—if you feed it detail. Face clarity from every angle requires:

Many cameras close to the athlete, dedicated angles for face,

Fast shutter (short exposure) to kill motion blur, ample light,

High resolution (4K or higher), and

Good calibration coverage.

Athlete360’s viewer supports frame-accurate pause, overlay tools, and lossless screenshots/short clips for handouts.

Where features also help other tabs
Ingest & job queue → benefits Content Studio (video tools)

3DGS / NeRF viewer → enriches VR/AR and Geospatial

Angle/annotation system → can appear in Project Hub (review meetings)

Report builder → available across tabs

“How long does it take?”
(High-level ranges so coaches can plan sessions; actual times depend on camera count, clip length, resolution, and GPU.)

Skeleton (Quick Analysis): typically minutes for a short clip; good for same-session review.

Field (first build): typically tens of minutes to hours once; then it’s instant reuse.

Volumetric (8–16 cams, short clip): from tens of minutes upward; longer if you push resolution/quality.

Ingest over Wi-Fi: seconds to a few minutes per camera for short clips; faster over wired or if recording direct-to-server.

(Everything runs server-side on your on-site GPU box to keep costs low and avoid third-party APIs.)

Putting it all together: coach day-of workflow
Open Athlete360 → Start Session → “QB Throw” profile → Quick Analysis

Cameras check in (green lights) → Count-in & Record → athlete throws 3–5 reps

Press Stop → ingest + auto-process server-side

Coach opens Review: orbit skeleton, scrub, draw angles; save screenshots/clips; compare to last week

(Optional later) Switch the same session to Volumetric if you used the big array; let it process while the next group works

Export Coach Report (PDF/MP4) to share

If you want, I can draft:

The Athlete360 UI (routes, React components, copy) with the one-button flow,

A docker-compose that spins up the open pipelines (FreeMoCap/COLMAP/OpenMVS/3DGS/NeRF/RVM),

The Three.js “SplatViewer” component to load orbitable 3D/4D splats in your existing viewer,

The Profiles for QB, pitcher, golfer (camera layout diagrams + default tools).

You said:
lets focus on just football for now (include all positions so position coaches can perform their own analysis. hypothetically, if the arizona cardinals invested in numerous high quality cameras mounted throughout their indoor practice field from all angles and have the footage automatically uploaded, what would a position coaches workflow be to capture a moving scene and work with the players? what about offensive and defensive coordinators getting an entire play captured in a moving scene? Amazon has a lot of cameras during games, if they had that data, could they do the same with real game scenes? is there a way in slate360 to save the scene, and is there a time limit for how long a moving scene would be? if mounted cameras are recording how could individual plays be cropped out to save processing time, would they need some start/stop remote? would it be possible to have a coaches access to do the processing and markups and then some interactive viewer or link that the player can get via email or text?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Absolutely—here’s how Athlete360 can run a Cardinals-style setup in plain English, tuned just for football. I’ll cover: position-coach workflow on a practice field with lots of mounted cameras, OC/DC full-play capture, using game feeds (what’s possible/what’s not), saving scenes and clip lengths, cropping individual plays, triggering/automation, permissions & sharing, and how this scales.

Position coaches on an indoor practice field
The hardware picture (once, then it’s set-and-forget)
Many fixed cameras around the field (sidelines, endlines, corners, mid-height and overhead catwalk positions). Prefer matched cams, 4K/60, short shutter; gen-locked or NTP/PTP time-synced.

Wired (PoE) or robust Wi-Fi 6/6E back to a local ingest server (GPU workstation or small rack).

Audio slate + whistle detection mics for event cues.

Optional field anchors (ArUco/chessboards) hidden in walls/pads for easy calibration refresh.

“Coach-proof” workflow (what a position coach actually does)
Open Athlete360 → “Start Practice”

Choose a Template (QB, WR, OL, DL, LB, DB, ST). Each template preloads: recommended camera set, default tools, and event cues to watch (e.g., ball snap).

Cameras check in automatically (green lights).

Coach doesn’t touch camera controls.

Hit “Go Live”

Athlete360 starts a rolling capture buffer (e.g., 20–30 s). Nothing to manage yet.

Mark a rep with almost zero effort:

Auto-tag on snap (ball-movement + whistle/voice cue) or

Tap a “Tag Rep” button on a phone/tablet or a wireless footswitch on the sideline.
Athlete360 grabs pre-roll + post-roll from the buffer (e.g., 4 s before → 8 s after) and forms a Play Clip.

Processing starts server-side, immediately

You choose the mode per template (defaulted so coaches don’t think about it):

Multi-Skeleton (fast; multiple players tracked; great for drills, OL/DL hand usage, WR releases).

Volumetric Focus (orbit-able moving 3D on selected players; heavier; ideal for QB, WR route break, DL move, kicker).

Field Context (practice field 3D built once; auto-reused).

Review on the sideline

Open the Rep Review: scrub timeline, orbit the scene (skeleton or volumetric), place angle/line tools (e.g., shoulder–hip separation, release height, pad level, strike timing).

One click: Save Screenshot/Clip with coach notes.

Optionally ghost-overlay the player’s rep vs. prior rep or a reference exemplar.

Share to player

“Send to Player” → choose player(s) → they get an expiring link by email/text with an interactive viewer (orbit + timeline + coach notes).

That’s it: start practice, tag reps, review, share. The rest (sync, ingest, processing, calibration reuse) is automated.

Coordinators (OC/DC) capturing full plays
Template: “Team 11-on-11”

Athlete360 prioritizes multi-skeleton to track everyone (IDs auto-assigned from jersey detection).

Optionally pick 2–3 focus players for Volumetric Focus (e.g., QB + primary WR + EDGE).

Auto-segment by play

Snap detection + whistle + line-to-gain movement isolates the play.

The system trims dead time and immediately launches processing for just that segment.

Coordinator Review

Global orbitable camera for the whole scene (skeletons).

Toggle heatmaps (spacing, pursuit angles, pass rush time-to-pressure), route trees, OL pocket geometry, coverage shells.

“Send Position Packs” → automatically slices the play into position-specific reviews (e.g., OL angles & timings for the OL room; DB leverage & hip flip for the DB room).

Could broadcast/game feeds be used the same way?
Yes, but with big caveats. Amazon/NFL broadcast uses many cameras, but:

You’d need access to the raw, time-synchronized, undistorted feeds from all cameras, not the cut/zoom broadcast program feed.

Typical TV angles are moving/zooming and not all cameras run continuously; that’s tough for accurate 3D.

If a team or broadcaster can export synchronized multi-view raws, Athlete360 can ingest and process similarly (multi-skeleton easily; volumetric if enough fixed-ish angles cover the subject throughout the play).

Bonus: Next Gen Stats (RFID/UWB) can be ingested to label identities and enrich analysis (routes, speeds) alongside the vision recon.

Saving scenes, clip length, and “time limits”
No hard time limit in Athlete360; it’s bounded by storage and what you choose to process.

Best practice is per-rep or per-play clips (e.g., ~6–12 s). You can tag longer sequences (team period), then auto-chunk by snap to save compute.

Scenes are saved as Projects → Sessions → Plays with full provenance (camera set, calibration, processing mode, player links).

Cropping out just the plays (with always-recording cameras)
You don’t need to spam start/stop on every camera:

Athlete360 runs a rolling buffer and auto-cut on snap/whistle cues.

Coaches can still press a Tag button (or voice keyword) to force a capture.

Post-practice, you can batch auto-trim the whole period by detected snaps.

Roles, permissions, and sharing
Coach role: can launch processing, add markups, create reports.

Player role: view-only interactive link (orbit/scrub), can comment/acknowledge, no processing controls.

Staff/analyst: can manage calibrations, templates, and pipelines.

Links are expiring, access-controlled, and watermarked when exported to MP4/PDF.

What else does a staff need (besides Slate360, a computer, and the cameras)?
Local ingest box with GPU (rack PC or workstation) that runs Athlete360 pipelines (Docker).

Network time sync (PTP/NTP or timecode) ensures perfect alignment.

PoE switch or reliable Wi-Fi; plenty of local NVMe storage.

Printed calibration boards (tucked away in known spots) to refresh camera calibration quickly.

Optional sideline remote (BLE footswitch) for “Tag Rep.”

Everything is surfaced in Athlete360; coaches stay in that tab.

How this supports every position (examples)
QB: shoulder–hip separation, stride length, release window, arm slot, foot strike timing; volumetric on key reps.

WR/TE: stance, first three steps, stem leverage, breakpoint angles, catch radius; skeleton for separation metrics; volumetric for contested catches.

RB: pad level, cut angles, decel/accel timing, ball carriage path.

OL: set depth, hand timing, strike location, hip/knee angles, pocket geometry overlay.

DL/EDGE: get-off, first contact timing, hand placement, rip/club/swim sequencing, arc path.

LB: read-step, pursuit angle, shuffle-to-scrape timing.

DB: leverage, hip flip timing, transition speed, catch-point positioning.

K/P/LS: plant distance, approach tempo, contact point, ball flight overlay.

Each template preselects tools and recommended camera subsets so coaches don’t fiddle with settings.

Processing scale (practical notes without hard numbers)
Multi-skeleton runs quickly and scales to full-team plays; great “same-session” review.

Volumetric is heavier and scales with # of cameras, resolution, clip length. Athlete360 can queue it so you still get quick skeleton reviews now, and higher-fidelity volumetric focus clips later in the session.

Multiple data sources (IMUs, audio, drone, etc.) add processing, but the system parallelizes tasks server-side.

Answers to your specific “can it…” questions
Save the scene? Yes—every play is a saved, re-openable Scene with orbit/scrub, markup, and exports.

Time limit for a moving scene? No fixed limit; use per-play segments to keep turnarounds tight.

Crop individual plays if cameras always record? Yes—rolling buffer + auto snap/whistle detection + optional manual tag. No need for per-camera start/stop.

Coach-only processing & markup; player gets a link? Yes—roles & expiring links via email/text with an interactive web viewer.

Offensive/defensive coordinators capturing entire plays? Yes—multi-skeleton for all 22; optional volumetric on focus players.

Use Amazon’s game cameras? Only if you can obtain the raw, time-synced multi-view feeds (not broadcast cuts) and you have rights; then yes, processed similarly.

All server-side? Yes—the ingest, calibration, tracking, volumetric, matting, and report generation run on the local GPU server; coaches use the Athlete360 UI.

Nice touches that keep clicks low
Profiles per position room (pre-baked settings & tools).

Auto-compose (if a field model exists, it’s applied automatically).

Smart defaults (if ≥8 cameras online, suggest Volumetric Focus for tagged reps; otherwise multi-skeleton).

Batch exports (Position Packs) for meetings.

One-key hotkeys (tag, next rep, add note, screenshot).

If you want, I can wire up a first pass of Athlete360 in your repo (routes, basic UI, roles, ingest watchers, and stubs for the open-source pipelines), plus a QB template with the tools you’ll use on day one.

You said:
would the coaches operate this from a tablet or by some other remote to start the cameras recording? what would record a whistle, what about other noises triggering recording? if they have an assistant clicking the start and stop, how long would the signal take to start recording? i don't understand that part. would the coaches Athlete360 tab be able to collect any data on what the player looked at and how long they did? is there a way for the players to communicate questions and for coaches to offer video feedback via selfie cell recordings? would an app be needed or would the coaches Slate360 and players viewer work for this? also, words like volumetric might not make sense to a football coach. can you make sure the names of everything are more general. like maybe it can be Interactive 3D. 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Totally—let’s make this coach-proof and use plain terms.

How coaches trigger captures (no tech juggling)
Best practice: don’t “start all cameras.” Keep them rolling to a short rolling buffer on the ingest box. Coaches just tag the rep, and Athlete360 grabs a few seconds before/after automatically. That means:

Zero “record” delay. You’re never waiting for a camera to spin up.

Fewer taps. No one is babysitting 12+ cameras.

Ways to tag a rep
Tablet (Athlete360, Coach view): big “Tag Rep” button.

Sideline remote: a small BLE footswitch or clicker the coach taps.

Auto-tag on whistle/snap: a field mic feeds an audio model looking for a known whistle cadence and ball-snap cues; you can enable/disable per drill.

Voice keyword (optional): e.g., “mark rep.”

If someone insists on start/stop: you can still do it from the tablet, but the rolling-buffer method removes start latency and missed first frames.

“What records the whistle? What about random noises?”
A field microphone (or two) mounts on the wall.

Athlete360 runs an on-site audio classifier tuned to your whistle pattern and snap cues.

To reduce false triggers: we use pattern + context (whistle + motion onset + ball movement). You can require both to tag a rep.

You can also set it to “Assist” (suggested tags appear on the tablet; coach taps to accept).

“If an assistant taps Start/Stop, how long until it starts?”
With the rolling buffer design, there’s no wait—the system already has the last few seconds. The tap simply cuts the segment (pre-roll + post-roll) and sends it to processing immediately. So the first step, the snap, and the release are captured without having to time a record button.

Simple, coach-friendly names
Interactive 3D (was “Volumetric 3D”): an orbit-around 3D clip of a moving player.

Body Lines (was “Skeleton”): clean stick-figure view with angle tools.

Field Model (was “Field Context”): a reusable 3D model of your practice field so clips play “in the field,” not in empty space.

What the coach uses on the sideline
One tablet (iPad/Android) running Slate360 in the browser (install as a PWA if you want an app-like icon).

Optional BLE footswitch on the ground to tag reps without looking down.

Everything else (multi-camera ingest, sync, processing) runs server-side on your on-site GPU box.

Player viewing, analytics, and two-way feedback
Yes to all of this—without a separate native app at first.

What we capture about viewing
Who watched, how long, which moments (e.g., “Release at 00:02.1 viewed 6×”).

Comment heatmap (frames with most coach/player comments).

Completion (did they finish, did they rewatch key frames).

Player ↔ coach communication
Players open a secure link (email/text) to the interactive viewer.

They can leave questions on exact frames.

Coaches can reply with a quick selfie video (built-in recorder in the browser) or mark up the clip and send back.

Players can also attach a cell-phone selfie drill response; it lands in the same play thread.

No separate app required. Later, if you want push notifications/offline capture, we can wrap the PWA or add native.

End-to-end coach workflow (football-only, all positions)
Open Athlete360 → Start Practice → Choose Template

QB / WR / OL / DL / LB / DB / ST / Team (11-on-11). Each template preloads the right camera set and tools.

Go Live (rolling buffer starts; cameras stay passive)

Tag Reps (foot switch, tablet tap, or auto on whistle/snap)

Review (seconds later)

Body Lines for everyone (fast).

Interactive 3D for focus players (QB, WR, EDGE) on selected reps.

Use Angle Tools (pad level, hip-shoulder, strike point, release height, route breakpoint).

Screenshot / short clip export with notes.

Share

Send position packs to players (expiring links).

See viewing analytics as they watch.

Archive

Each rep is saved as Practice ▶ Session ▶ Play with all markups and exports.

Offensive & Defensive Coordinators (entire play)
Use the Team (11-on-11) template.

Athlete360 tracks all 22 in Body Lines for spacing/timing and lets you pick 2–3 focus players to render as Interactive 3D on that same play.

Coordinators get overlays: route trees, pocket geometry, pursuit angles, time-to-pressure, coverage shells.

Using broadcast/game cameras later
If you can obtain the raw, time-synced feeds (not just the edited broadcast), Athlete360 can ingest them and run the same pipelines. Moving zoom cams are workable for Body Lines; Interactive 3D requires enough overlapping angles that see the player continuously.

Clip length, saving, and trimming
No fixed time limit per moving scene—clips are as long as you tag.

Best practice is per-play segments.

Always-recording rigs are auto-trimmed by snap/whistle (or your tag), so you don’t waste compute on dead time.

Will multiple data sources slow things down?
More inputs = more to process, yes—but Athlete360 parallelizes jobs on the server.

Coaches still get fast Body Lines first; Interactive 3D focus clips finish as they continue practice or while in meetings.

Cropping out cameras in the scene
Layout keeps cameras out of the action.

Athlete360 has per-camera masks (set once, reused) + optional background matting to suppress stands, tripods, staff.

Everything server-side?
Yes. Ingest, sync, detection, recon, and exports all run on the on-site GPU workstation. The tablet is only a controller/viewer.

What a team needs on day one (besides cams + Slate360)
On-site GPU box (rack/workstation), fast NVMe, wired LAN or solid Wi-Fi 6/6E.

Time sync (PTP/NTP or timecode pucks).

Field mic (for whistle/snap cues).

One tablet per coach group (or just one per side of the field).

Optional BLE footswitch for hands-free tagging.

If you want, I’ll draft the Athlete360 UI (tablet-friendly) with:

Big “Go Live” + “Tag Rep” controls,

Templates for each position,

Coach/player frame-comments and selfie-reply,

Simple names: Body Lines, Interactive 3D, Field Model,

Server-side job queue view (so staff can monitor without exposing tech to coaches).

We can also wire the analytics panel (who watched, how long, which moments) and the secure sharing links now, while we stub the reconstruction back-end so you can run demo flows immediately.
